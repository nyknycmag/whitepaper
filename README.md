## Abstract

> NYKNYC is an outreach initiative and community dedicated to spreading news and education about cryptocurrencies and technologies that enhance individual freedom and privacy. The initiative consists of several parts and the main one is Magazine for cryptonatives.

# 1. Introduction

The current information market in the cryptocurrency space is messy and tribalistic.

Most information is produced by platforms and media that seemingly have no values or code of ethics. They do not care about freedom or decentralization. They do not verify their sources, they support dubious projects, they do not mind cooperating with centralized exchanges and projects, and they are often advocates of regulation.

Another source of information are collectivist groups such as BTC/ETH maximalists. Their media are often interested in basic values, but due to the echo chamber around them, they fail to look at issues from a higher perspective. They deliberately portray a distorted and incomplete view of today's world to their audience.

Unprincipled commerce or blunt collectivism is thus the main thing that today's person interested in cryptocurrencies will encounter. The former creates chaos and the latter creates an unhealthy cults.

Our goal is to create a counter-culture against these two approaches. We want to create an information resource, chain-agnostic cult and community based not on one cryptocurrency or ecosystem but on the promotion of basic values such as freedom, openness, decentralization, neutrality or privacy.

>   ― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

## 2.1. Brand

The name "NYKNYC" is an abbreviation for "*Not your keys, not your coins*". It’s a symbol and the basic rule of our space that shows and describes exactly what our initiative is about. This symbol serves as the anchor around which we build our cult.

## 2.2. Values

Guiding values of our movement are defined by these words:
 - decentralization
 - freedom
 - self-regulation
 - diversity
 - censorship-resistance
 - neutrality
 - privacy
 - self-custody
 - no-bullshit
 - resilience
 - honesty
 - humour & fun

## 2.3. Community

The most important thing we build is community - a group of people who share common interests.

TODO

## 2.4. Foundation

A transparent non-profit decentralized autonomnous organization (DAO) that protects the brand and the community and redistributes money from commercial sub-initiatives to non-profit ones within *Commonwealth*.

### 2.4.1. Legal entity

TODO

## 2.5. Commonwealth

The movement includes many individual sub-initiatives that are managed separately and independently. It's a commonwealth of non-profit but also for-profit initiatives focusing on different segments. There is no central leadership.

The relationship between *the Foundation* and the various commonwealth initiatives is similar to a [franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising). *The Movement*, through *the Foundation*, provides its brand and community to the initiative, based on agreed terms.

Don't confuse initiatives and legal entities - legal entities can server multiple initiatives. For example, a legal entity for Magazine contain Magazine and Store intitiatives and is for-profit.

The following initiatives are presented in this document:
 - Magazine
 - Store
 - Publishing
 - Events
 - Research
 - Awards
 - Physical spaces
 - Lab

*\*The only significant power the Foundation has is to protect the brand and community and, as a non-profit organization, to transparently redistribute money.*

## 2.6. Cooperation

We collaborate with global and local partners and communities across the ecosystem which share similar values. We only work with reputable organisations and communities.

Examples of groups we are interested in working with:
 - [Department of Decentralization](https://protocol.berlin/decentralization/) (DoD) - advocate decentralization and open-source
 - [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) (EFF) - advocate for privacy rights and digital freedoms

# 3. Proposed initiatives

## 3.1. Magazine

> independent magazine for cryptonatives // cryptocurrencies, technology, arts, culture, lifestyle, freedom 

A sustainable online news and information platform that serve as the backbone of our movement. The platform is web3 application which operate on a freemium model, where basic content are free and the rest are only be available to people who pay for a unified membership fee (10 EUR at start).

The goal is to build a reputable resource that gives people a quality information service and where also external authors can publish their analysis and reports (like [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/)), but in unbiased and more neutral way.

Main features:
 - unbiased reporting
 - in-depth research
 - community-driven insights
 - curated approach

### 3.1.1. Content

We produce high quality and unique content, from renowned authors, curated by our Editorial Team. In addition to cryptocurrencies and technology, we also cover related overlapping topics such as art, culture and lifestyle. Our content is intended to be useful and interesting for the whole spectrum of people - from beginners to experts. We use all modern ways of delivering information such as articles, podcasts and videos.

We strive to honor the craft of journalism and bring you unbiased and verified information in an entertaining and readable way.

#### 3.1.1.1. Topics

The main topics covered by our magazine are:

#### 3.1.1.3. Programme period

The basic unit of time for which content is planned. At launch it is one calendar month. The content for the next period is decided 2 weeks before the start of that period.

#### 3.1.1.4. Content structure

Content is structured into so-called "series". Each series has its own editor(s) and schedule. Users can "follow" each series in the interface to tailor the content. The series for the next "program period" is decided by the Editorial Team, taking into account the vote of $NYKNYC token-holders.

The series can be regular, one-off or irregular:
 - Regular series - recurring content, such as "A Week in Cryptocurrencies"
 - One-off series - multi-part content on a specific topic, for example "Introduction to ZK"
 - Irregular series - special and unpredictable events, such as hacks and exploits

#### 3.1.1.5. Using decentralised storage

We store all our content on decetralized storage such as Arweave or IPFS.

#### 3.1.1.6. NFT-native

Each piece of content will have an NFT generated on the second layer of Ethereum that members will be able to “collect” (see the “Mint as NFT“ section).

### 3.1.2. Authors

#### 3.1.2.1. Editorial Team

The people who is responsible for the content of the magazine. At launch, this is 5-10 individuals from different sectors and with different expertise. Their job is to create or curate all the content, or cooperate with External authors.

#### 3.1.2.2. External authors

The content will not only consist of the core Editorial Team, but we also want to give opportunity to external authors to present their opinions and analyses that are in line with our Code of Conduct. Content from external authors is always distinguished from the rest of the content.

#### 3.1.2.3. Code of Conduct

1. We promote decentralized and open cryptocurrencies and technologies.
2. We gather the information we need to write our texts with one motivation: to truthfully inform the public about the things we think are important and should be of interest to them.
3. We publish only verified information and are careful to verify our sources rigorously.
4. The people and projects we report on are given a voice in the news that affects them negatively. The fact that those concerned refuse to comment to us is not a reason for not publishing an article.
5. No one from outside the editorial office interferes in the work of the editorial team. This rule also extends to the owners of NYCKYC.
6. Members of the editorial staff do not write reports on organizations or groups of which they are members, or on matters in which they have a vested interest, including their civic activities.
7. We fundamentally distinguish real crypto-news from pseudo-crypto-news from the centralized world.
8. We consistently separate news and opinion content. Advertising or any sponsored content is also clearly distinguished.
9. We are not infallible. If we make a mistake, we admit it, apologize and correct it.
10. The editorial team refers to anonymous sources in its reporting only minimally and only when the public interest cannot be served in any other way. The identity of the anonymous source is always known to the text editor or editor-in-chief.
11. The editorial staff consistently protects its sources from anyone, including government authorities.
12. No-bullshit policy: we do not report (positively) on unverified and untrustworthy projects (i.e. scams or projects with unhealthy signals).

### 3.1.3. Subscription

The basic subscription is uniform for the entire platform and the starting price is set at 10 EUR for 30 days. After paying the subscription fee, the person gets access to all content on the platform. The membership fee can be paid in cryptocurrencies or by credit card for any length of time, with a minimum amount of 10 EUR.

Various bonuses and benefits are available for subscribers. One of the main one is that members receive portion of $NYKNYC tokens for every second of membership elapsed. Users can claim this tokens to their wallet and use it to vote on future content, trade for merchandise, etc. (see the "$NYKNYC token" section for more information).

#### 3.1.3.1. Distribution of subscription income

Subscription profit is distributed using the following formula:
 - 5% - NYKNYC Foundation
 - 10% - operation, maintenance and PR of the platform (magazine)
 - 35% - content authors split by team consensus (using [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) tool)
 - 50% - content authors split by real “consumption”

### 3.1.4. Frontend (dApp)

The Magazine platform is primarily a web3 application. Users are able to log in with their wallet, interact with the content or customize their experience based on that.

The basic interactions with the content are:
 - rating - like or dislike
 - comments
 - tipping - financial support
 - collecting - mint as NFT

#### 3.1.4.1. Subscription process

The option to become a member should be as simple as possible. We try to use modern technology to make the process even more convenient. We would like to introduce the possibility to pay with "streaming” tokens (like [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/)).

#### 3.1.4.2. Mint as NFT

Each article, podcast or video can be "collected" by the user by minting the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) associated with that content. This is the same functionality you know from [Mirror](https://support.mirror.xyz/hc/en-us/articles/7929300425620-How-are-entries-collectable-on-Mirror-), for example. The NFT is using the ERC721 standard and the minting is take place on the second layer of Ethereum.

Minting is available only to paid members.

#### 3.1.4.3. Important indicators

We want to keep visitors up to date on the basic parameters of the ecosystem. These parameters and charts will be displayed on the site, in collaboration with NYKNYC Research.

Examples of monitored parameters:
 - ETH & BTC price
 - Value locked ([DefiLlama TVL](https://defillama.com/))
 - Layer2s - TVL, transactions per second on [L2BEAT](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary)
 - Current price of Gas fees
 - Crypto-Indexes such as the [State of Crypto Index](https://a16zcrypto.com/stateofcrypto/)
 - Network health - [Client Diversity](https://clientdiversity.org/), [Lido Staking marketshare](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), [OFAC Compliant Blocks](https://www.mevwatch.info/) etc.

### 3.1.5. Language mutations

Each language version has its own Editorial Team. We are starting with an English (global) and a Czech-language version, and everything will work very interconnected at the beginning, but later on the different language Editorial Teams should be independent and equal. The individual series are often translated from English to the local language and vice versa.

### 3.1.6. Newsletter

TODO

### 3.1.7. Printed magazine

TODO

### 3.1.8. $NYKNYC Token

Utility token (ERC-20 standard), which members receive for every second of their membership that elapses. Members can claim this token on their wallet and use it for various things:

 - decide future content - vote on the series for the next program period
 - exchange for merchandise, partners offers or other bonuses
   
### 3.1.9. Comparison with competitors

#### 3.1.9.1. Cryptocurrency news sites

Example: [CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/), [CoinDesk](https://coindesk.com/), [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/), [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/)

These media have no principles, they are full of ads, promotion of VCs and content have very poor quality. Too much of the content is CeFi and information about centralized services and regulations that have nothing to do with open cryptocurrencies. Lack of critical thinking.

Our solution: Less bullshit, more responsibility and quality

#### 3.1.9.2. Maximalist information sources

Example: [Bitcoin Magazine](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/), [Bankless](https://www.bankless.com/), [Citadel21](https://www.citadel21.com/)

Mostly biased content created by people living in their echo chamber. Often offers quality content, but there is usually lack to perceive the wider circumstances and ecosystem. Critical thinking exists, but it is very much distorted by tribalism.

Our solution: Less collectivism, more individualism

#### 3.1.9.3. Broader tech publications with crypto section

Example: [Forbes Crypto](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/), [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/c/web3), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/category/cryptocurrency/), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/tag/cryptocurrency/), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/)

The cryptocurrency world is complex - this media often looks at the world through the “centralized” lens of influential cryptocurrency corporations or through the lens of the old financial system. Very little is given to true innovation.

Our solution: Less surface-level reporting, deeper dives into the tech and innovation

#### 3.1.9.4. Conclusion

In essence, our aim is to bridge the gaps observed in existing mediums, offering a comprehensive, reliable, and holistic perspective on cryptocurrency. We envision a platform where enthusiasts, beginners, and experts alike can come together to obtain and share knowledge, free from the shackles of bias and misinformation.

## 3.2. Store

Online store with a wide range of products related to cryptocurrencies and our topics. From t-shirts to HW wallets. Possibility of payment by cryptocurrency or credit card. We deliver worldwide, with the option of private delivery.

Main features of our shop:
 - wide range of products
 - pro-customer approach
 - superfast delivery
 - cryptocurrency payment option (incl. private tokens)

TODO

## 3.7. Space

Physical places that are used to promote our initiatives, the topics our initiatives address and for community gatherings. Our spaces are heavily inspired by the [Paralelní Polis](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/) concept, in the sense of an open and liberal place supporting and spreading individual freedoms. They are also important in spreading awareness of our brand as whole, similar way like [Apple Stores](https://www.apple.com/retail/), [Taschen Stores](https://www.taschen.com/en/stores) etc. 

These venues are independently managed and we only provide brand, know-how and financial support through mutual cooperation.

## 3.8. Lab
